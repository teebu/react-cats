Vite - Fast, modern, simple migration path for SPAs\n2. Next.js - Full framework with SSR/SSG capabilities\n3. Remix - Modern full-stack framework\n4. Manual webpack/esbuild config\n\nCriteria:\n- Migration effort (code changes required)\n- Build performance\n- Developer experience\n- Long-term maintenance\n- Security posture\n- Compatibility with current dependencies (react-router-dom v7, React 18)\n\nDeliverable: Document with recommendation and migration plan","notes":"# Migration Research: Vite vs Next.js\n\n## Recommendation: **Vite**\n\nAfter researching migration options, Vite is the optimal choice for this project.\n\n### Why Vite?\n1. **Perfect fit for this SPA**: This is a client-side only app using HashRouter - no SSR/SSG needed\n2. **Minimal migration effort**: Can be completed in ~30 minutes with minimal code changes\n3. **Fast development**: 10-100x faster HMR and startup times vs CRA\n4. **Full compatibility**: Works seamlessly with React 18 and react-router-dom v7\n5. **Security**: Latest Vite has no known vulnerabilities\n\n### Why Not Next.js?\n- Next.js is overkill for this simple SPA\n- Requires more significant code changes (SSR/SSG patterns)\n- Heavier framework for a project that doesn't need server-side rendering\n- More complex migration path\n\n### Migration Steps (Vite)\n1. Remove react-scripts dependency\n2. Install Vite and @vitejs/plugin-react\n3. Move index.html to project root\n4. Create vite.config.js\n5. Update environment variables (REACT_APP_ → VITE_)\n6.
